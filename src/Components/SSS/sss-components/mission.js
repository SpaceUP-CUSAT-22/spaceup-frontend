    Ideas are mere dreams if not shared. Humans
have an urge to dream, share, witness, and
believe.
In
the
science
community,
we
celebrated all. We welcome ideas and the mind
gave birth to them. Curiosity when shared
among each other leads to the answers and
questions we never asked. We are committed
to building a community and a given space to
these ideas and to exchange them within the
likes of them.
